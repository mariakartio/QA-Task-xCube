Part 1: Manual Testing

Since the functionality of the tab home, search and my library covers many features and the scope of the test is not defined in the assessment and hence writing test cases for all of them will be many in numbers Therefore, I have narrowed down the scope of test

Home:
Basic filter based on music and podcast, albums appear based on the artist selected

Search:
search based on artist
search based on podcast
search based on songs
cancel button

Your library:
display selected artist
create a new playlist
add artist
add podcast and shows works correct
changing the display view

Part 2: I couldn't automate the e2e test scenarios due to lack of device and resources. 

If I were to automate any scenarios from the mentioned test cases in part 1 then:

- Viewing and verifying elements
- Navigating from one tab to another
- Search for the artist hit enter and assert if they appear in the results
